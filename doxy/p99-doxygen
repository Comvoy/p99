# This file is meant to ease the documentation with doxygen of code
# that uses P99.  It just defines some macros and watches that doxygen
# interprets them well.  Include this file here into your "Doxyfile"
# with the following two lines
#
# @INCLUDE_PATH          += doxy/
# @INCLUDE                = p99-doxygen
#
# where the path should correspond to the directory where you found
# this configuration file here.
#
# Additionally you should probably also set something like
#
# INCLUDE_PATH           += /your/path/to/p99/
# TAGFILES               += "p99-tagfile = http://p99.gforge.inria.fr/p99-html/"
#
# to ensure that your run of doxygen also actually see the P99 include
# files and also that the P99 documentation is nicely linked.
#
# Please share your experience of using P99 together with doxygen with
# us and in particular tell us if you had to add to the following
# definitions to make the result of doxygen look nicer.

# Prefixes that P99 uses for internal use
EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS        += P00_* p00_* P99X__* p99x__*

# A set of macros that are just too complicated that doxygen can make
# something reasonable out of them.

  <b>Subject:</b> Inconsistent specifications for arithmetic on
  atomic objects.</p>


  <p><b>Summary</b></p>


<p>
  Whereas its intent is clear, the text in the C standard that
  concerns atomics has several consistency problems. There are
  contradictions and the standard vocabulary is not always applied
  correctly.
</p>
  <p><b>Problem discussion</b></p>

    <p><em>— Memory order of operators —</em></p>

<p>
  The following sections on arithmetic operators, all specify that if
  they are applied to an atomic object as an operand of <b>any</b>
  arithmetic base type, the memory order sematic
  is <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>6.2.6.1 Loads and stores of objects with atomic types are done
    with <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> semantics.</li>
  <li>6.5.2.4 (postfix <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>)</li>
  <li>6.5.16.2 Compound assignment. No constraints formulated
  concerning traps for integer types. In contrast to that, no floating
  exceptions for floating types are allowed. Also, this defines atomic
  operations for <b>all</b> arithmetic operands, including some that
  don't have library calls
  (<code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>%=</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  No such mention is made for
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  6.5.3.1 (prefix <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>), although it
  explicitly states that these operators are defined to be equivalent
  to <code>+= 1</code> and <code>-= 1</code>, respectively.
  </li>
  <li>
  6.5.16.1 Simple assignment, although the paragraph about store says
  that such a store should be  <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

    <p><em>— Integer representations and erroneous operations —</em></p>

<p>
  Concerning the generic library calls, they state in 7.17.7.5
</p>

<p class="quote">
  For signed integer types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s
  complement representation with silent wrap-around on overflow; there
  are no undefined results.
</p>

<p>and</p>

<p class="quote">
  For address types, the result may be an undefined address, but the
  operations otherwise have no undefined behavior.
</p>

<p>
  Can the sign representation depend on the operation that we apply to
  an object? Are these operations supposed to be consistent between
  operator and function notation? What is an <em>address type</em>?
</p>

<p><em>— Operators versus generic functions —</em></p>

<p>
  Then a <b>Note</b> (7.17.7.5 p 5) states
</p>

<p class="quote">
  The operation of the atomic_fetch and modify generic functions are
  nearly equivalent to the operation of the
  corresponding <code>op=</code> compound assignment operators. The
  only differences are that the compound assignment operators are not
  guaranteed to operate atomically, ...
</p>

<p>
  Although there are obviously also operators that act on atomic
  objects, 5.1.2.4 p 4 gives the completely false impression that
  atomic operations would only be a matter of the C library:
</p>

<p class="quote">
  The library defines a number of atomic operations (7.17) ...
</p>

<p><em>— Pointer types are missing for <code>atomic_fetch_OP</code> —</em></p>

<p>
  In the general introduction (7.17.1 p4) there is explicitly an
  extension of the notations to atomic pointer types:
</p>

<p class="quote">
  For atomic pointer types, <code>M</code> is <code>ptrdiff_t</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Whereas the only section where this notation is relevant (7.17.7.5
  <code>atomic_fetch_OP</code>) is restricted to <em>atomic integer
  types</em>, but then later talks about the result of such operations
  on <em>address types</em>.
</p>

<p><em>— Vocabulary —</em></p>

<p>
  For the vocabulary, there is a mixture of the use of the verb
  combinations between <em>load/store</em>, <em>read/write</em>
  and <em>fetch/assign</em>.  What is the difference? Is there any?
</p>


<p>
  This is
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    contradictory (the Note is not normative, but still wrong),
  </li>
  <li>
    confusing (<code>=</code> is handled different
    from <code>op=</code>, operators are not mentioned where they
    should),
  </li>
  <li>
    weird (the sign representation is described as the result of an
    operation, not as the value representation of a data type; what is
    "no undefined behavior" of a address operation?)
  </li>
  <li>
    inconsistent (operators may result in any sign representation ?,
    and can trap, generic functions are safe)
  </li>
  <li>
    incomplete (the set of operators and generic functions are distinct)
  </li>
</ul>

  <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>
  Combining all these texts, a number of constraints emerge for
  arithmetic types on platforms that support the atomics
  extension. They would better be stated as such.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Since sign representation is a property of a type and not an
    operation, all signed integer types must have two's representation
    for negative values.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pointer arithmetic has a variant that always has defined behavior,
    only that the stored address may be invalid, if the addition or
    subtraction passed beyond the boundaries of the object.
  </li>
  <li>
    Binary integer operations <code>+</code>,
    <code>-</code>, <code>&</code>, <code>|</code> and <code>^</code>
    must have versions that do not trap.
  </li>
  <li>
    All floating point operations must have versions that don't raise
    signals.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The distinction in operations on atomics that are realized by
  operators (all arithmetic) and only by generic functions is
  arbitrary. As soon as a type has a
  lock-free <code>atomic_compare_exchange</code> operation,
  all <code>fetch_op</code> or <code>op_fetch</code> generic functions
  can be synthesized almost trivially.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why are atomic operations on pointer types and floating point
  types restricted to applying the operator, and don't allow for the
  generic function?</li>
</ul>


  <p><b>Current practice</b></p>

<p>
  Both gcc and clang permit <code>atomic_fetch_OP</code> on atomic
  pointer types.
</p>
<p>
 Both disallow floating point types for the functions but not for the
 operators.
</p>
<p>
  Gcc extends the infrastructure that it provides of atomics
  to <code>op_fetch</code> generic fuctions and adds a new
  operator <code>nand</code>.
</p>

<p><b>Suggested strategy for improvement</b><br/></p>

<p>I suggest to first do some minimal changes to the text with a TC to
  avoid its contradictions and to centralize its requirements. Then,
  in a feature request for a new version of the standard we could
  discuss to add some more features that would make the approach
  internally consistent.</p>

<p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b><br/></p>

<p>Change the beginning of 5.1.2.4 p5:</p>

<p class="strike">
  The library defines a number of atomic operations (7.17) and
  operations on mutexes (7.26.4) that are specially identified as
  synchronization operations.
</p>

<p>to</p>

<p class="alternative">
  There are a number of operations that are specially identified as
  synchronization operations: if the implementation supports the
  atomics extension these are operators and generic functions that act
  on atomic objects (6.5 and 7.17); if the implementation supports the
  thread extension these are operations on mutexes (7.26.4).
</p>


<p>Replace paragraph 6.2.6.1 p9</p>

<p class="strike">
 Loads and stores of objects with atomic types are done with
 memory_order_seq_cst semantics.
</p>

<p>
  by the following
</P>

<p class="alternative">
  All operations that act on atomic objects that do not specify
  otherwise have <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> memory
  consistency. If the operation with identical values on the
  unqualified type is erroneous it results in an unspecific object
  representation, that may or may not be an invalid value for the
  type, such as an invalid address or a floating point NaN. Thereby no
  such operation may by itself raise a signal, a trap, a floating
  point exception or result otherwise in an interruption of the
  control flow.FOOTNOTE<br /><br />
</p>


<p class="alternative">
  FOOTNOTE Whether or not an atomic operation may be interrupted by a
  signal depends on the lock-free property of the underlying type.
</p>

<p>
  Insert a new paragraph after 6.2.6.2 p2
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  Implementations that support the atomics extension, represent all
  signed integers with two's complement such that the object
  representation with sign bit 1 and all value bits zero is a normal
  value.
</p>

<p>
  Insert a new paragraph after 6.5 p3
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  An operation on an lvalue with an atomic type, that consists of the
  evaluation of the object, an optional arithmetic operation and a
  side effect for updating the stored value forms a single
  read-modify-write operation.
</p>

<p>
  Remove the following phrase in 6.5.2.4 p2:
</p>

<p class="strike">
  Postfix <code>++</code> on an object with atomic type is a
  read-modify-write operation with memory_order_seq_cst memory order
  semantics.
</>

<p>
  Remove the following phrase in 6.5.16.2 p3:
</p>

<p class="strike">
  If <b>E1</b> has an atomic type, compound assignment is a
  read-modify-write operation with memory_order_seq_cst memory order
  semantic
</>

<p>
  Replace 7.17.7 p1
</p>

<p class="strike">
  There are only a few kinds of operations on atomic types, though there are many
  instances of those kinds. This subclause specifies each general kind.
</p>

<p>
  by
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  In addition to the operations on atomic objects that are described
  by operators, there are a few kinds of operations that are specified
  as generic functions. This subclause specifies each generic
  function.  After evaluation of its arguments, each of these generic
  functions forms a single read, write or read-modify-write operation
  with same general properties as described in 6.2.6.1 p9.
</p>

<p>
  Assuming that the intent of 7.17.7.5 has been to allow operations on
  atomic pointer types, in p1, change:
</p>

<p class="strike">
  ... to an object of any atomic integer type. None of these
  operations is applicable to <code>atomic_bool</code>
</p>

<p>
  to
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  ... to an object of any atomic integer or pointer type, as long as
   the unqualified type is valid as left operand of the corresponding
   operator <code>op=</code>.FOOTNOTE<br/> <br/>

  FOOTNOTE: Thus these operations are not permitted for pointers to
  atomic <code>_Bool</code>, and only "add" and "sub" variants are
  permitted for atomic pointer types.
</p>

<p>
  Since this topic is then covered already by a more general section,
  remove this sentence from p3:
</p>

<p class="strike">
 For address types, the result may be an undefined address, but the
 operations otherwise have no undefined behavior.
</p>

<p>
  In 7.17.7.5 p 5 replace:
</p>

<p class="strike">
  ... the compound assignment operators are not guaranteed to operate
  atomically, and ...
</p>

<p>
  by
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  ... the <code>order</code> parameter may make the memory consistency
  less strict than <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>, and that ...
</p>

<p><b>Future Directions</b><br/></p>

<p>An editorial revision of the C standard should clarify the
  vocabulary for the use of the
  terms <em>load</em>, <em>store</em>, <em>read</em>, <em>write</em>, <em>modify</em>, <em>fetch</em>
  and <em>assign</em>.
</p>

<p>
  A feature revision of the standard should:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Add generic interfaces for all arithmetic operations. That is, it
    should add function-like interfaces for the missing
    operators <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>%=</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Add atomic pointer types (if not by the TC above) and atomic
    floating point types to the permitted types of the function-like
    arithmetic operations, such that they are uniformly defined for
    all types where the corresponding operator applies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add generic interfaces <code>atomic_OP_fetch</code> for
    all <code>atomic_fetch_OP</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reduce 7.17.6 "Atomic integer types" to just a definition
    of <code>typedef</code> as indicated in the table.
  </li>
</ul>

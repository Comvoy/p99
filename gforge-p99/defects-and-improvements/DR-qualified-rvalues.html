<h1>Defect Report relative to n1570: underspecification for
  qualified rvalues</h1>

<h2>Problem statement</h2>

<p>
The dealing of rvalues with qualified types is largely underspecified
in all versions of the C standard. This didn't surface as a problem
until C11, since until then the type of an expression was not
observable but only its value.
</p>
<p>
  With C11 now a problem arises for type generic primary expressions;
  with <code>_Generic</code> type qualifications of values have become
  observable.
</p>

<p>
  The standard in any of its versions has not much to say when it
  comes to qualified types for rvalues. They definitively do exist,
  since the cast operator (6.5.4p2) explicitly specifies that the type
  could be qualified. That section on casts also has the only
  indication that relates to rvalues. There is a footnote (thus not
  normative) that says
</p>
<p  class="quote">
  89) A cast does not yield an lvalue. Thus, a cast to a qualified
  type has the same effect as a cast to the unqualified version of the
  type.
</p>

<p>
  That could mean two things:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>the effective type of the resulting rvalue is unqualified</li>
  <li>all operators that will accept the rvalue as an operand will act
    all the same whether the type is qualified or not</li>
</ol>

<p>doing some tests I have found that clang and gcc disagree on this
point. (gcc doesn't have <code>_Generic</code>, yet, but other builtins to observe
types)
</p>

<p>clang seems to implement 1., gcc 2. They agree for lvalues like
this
</p>
<pre>
_Generic((double const){ 0 },
         default: 0,
         double const: 1)
</pre>

<p>
  both evaluate it to <code>1</code>.
</p>
<p>
  They disagree on the outcome for rvalues
</p>
<pre>
_Generic((double const)0,
         default: 0,
         double const: 1)
</pre>
<p>
  clang gives <code>0</code>, gcc gives <code>1</code>.
</p>
<p>
  (for gcc all with caution that it doesn't have <code>_Generic</code>
  yet, but that this was obtained using an emulation of it by means of
  other gcc builtins)
</p>

<p>
  So that situation can easily lead to simple programs that have a
  behavior that depends on an undocumented choice and thus observe
  <em>unspecified behavior</em>.
</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>


<h3>Importance of observability of qualifiers</h3>
<p>
  This is not a defect of the <code>_Generic</code> construct
  itself. The intention is clearly to distinguish all types (with the
  exception of VM types) that are not compatible, thus to allow to
  distinguish all 8 different forms of qualifications of a type
  (resp. 16 for pointer types) that can be obtained from the
  qualifiers <code>_Atomic</code>, <code>const</code>,
  <code>volatile</code> (and <code>restrict</code>).
</p>
<p>
  For type generic expressions that are intended to operate on
  lvalues, such distinction can be crucial for any of the four
  qualifiers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>For <code>const</code> or <code>volatile</code> qualified
  lvalues there might be situations where application code might want
  to use an unqualified compound literal in place of the controlling
  expression.</li>

  <li>For <code>_Atomic</code> qualified lvalues there might be
  situations where application code might want to select a different
  function than for expressions with same base type but without such a
  qualifier.</li>

  <li><code>restrict</code> (or not) qualified pointers may enable an
  application to select different algorithms or functions
  (e.g <code>memcopy</code> versus <code>memmove</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lvalue conversion of the controlling expression of the generic
  selection is not a solution</h3>

<p>
  Up to now, the conversions of 6.3.2.1 do not apply to primary
  expressions but only to operators. E.g in the following
</p>
<pre>
double A[5];
double (*B)[5] = &A;
double (*C)[5] = &(A);
</pre>

<p>
  <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> should be initialized to the same
  value, the address of <code>A</code>. If in <code>(A)</code> the
  primary expression <code>()</code> would enforce a decay of the
  array to a pointer (and thus to an rvalue) the initialization
  expression for <code>C</code> would be a constraint violation.
</p>
<p>
  So it seems obvious that the conversions in 6.3.2 ("Other Operands")
  are not intended to be applied to primary expressions.
</p>
<p>
  Also the conversions in 6.3.2 are not consistent with respect to
  qualifiers.  The only conversion that explicitly drops qualifiers is
  lvalue conversion (6.3.2.1p2).  Array to pointer conversion
  (6.3.2.1p3) doesn't change qualifiers on the base type. Pointer
  conversion then, in 6.3.2.3, may add qualifiers to the base type
  when converting.
</p>

<h3>Origin</h3>
<p>
  Two different constructs can be at the origin of a qualification of
  an rvalue:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>casts, but only for scalar types</li>
  <li>function evaluation, resulting in any type but an array or
  function type.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Both constructs explicitly allow for qualifiers to be applied to the
  type. In particular 6.7.6.3p15 emphasizes (and constrains) the
  return type of function specifications to have compatible types,
  thus indicating that the qualification of the return type bares a
  semantic meaning.
</p>

<h3>Operations</h3>
<p>
  If we suppose that any rvalue expression carries its qualification
  further, other operations (e.g unary or binary <code>+</code>) could
  or could not result in qualified rvalues. The conversion rules in
  6.3 and in particular the usual arithmetic conversions in 6.3.1.8
  that allow to determine a common real type don't specify rules to
  deal with qualifiers.
</p>

<p>
  It seems that a lot of compilers already warn on such "superfluous"
  qualifications, but in view of type generic primary expression it is
  not clear that such warnings are still adequate.
</p>

<h2>Proposed solutions</h2>
<p>
  There doesn't seem to be an easy solution to this defect, and the
  proposed solutions (as below or even differently) probably will need
  some discussion and investigations about their implications on
  existing code before a consensus could be reached.
</p>

<h3>Require the implementation to specify its choice</h3>
<p>
  This is (to my opinion) the worst solution, because the potential
  different code paths that an application code could take are
  numerous. There are 4 different qualifiers to handle and code that
  would have to rely on enumerating all combinations of different
  generic choices can quickly become a maintenance nightmare.
</p>
<p>
  Also, implementations that chose to keep qualifiers on rvalues would
  have to decide (and document) by their own what the rules would be
  when operators are applied to such qualified rvalues.
</p>

<h3>Keep all qualifiers on types of rvalue expressions</h3>

<p>
  In particular cumulate qualifiers from operands with different qualifiers.
</p>

<p>
  How to drop qualifiers for type generic expressions?
</p>


<h3>Require the implementation to provide a feature test macro</h3>
<p>
  This solution would already be a bit better than the previous one,
  since applications that compose type generic macros could select
  between two (or several) implementations. But the main problems
  (complexity and underspecification of operations) would remain.
</p>

<h3>Drop all qualifiers from the controlling expression of the generic selection</h3>

<p>
  This is not an ideal solution, since it would remove a lot of
  expressiveness from the generic selection construct. Lvalues could
  no be distinguished for their qualifiers:
</p>

<pre>
void f(double*);
#define F(X) _Generic((X), double: f)(&(X))

double const A = 42;
F(A);
</pre>

<p>
  Here dropping the qualifiers of <code>A</code> would result in a
  choice of <code>f</code> and in the evaluation
  of <code>f(&A)</code>. In case that <code>f</code> modifies its
  argument object (which we can't know) this would lead to undefined
  behavior.
</p>
<p>
  Not dropping the qualifiers would lead to a compile time constraint
  violation, because none of the types in the type generic expression
  matches. So here an implementation would be forced to issue a
  diagnostic, whereas if qualifiers are dropped the diagnostic is not
  mandatory.
</p>


<h3>Drop all qualifiers of rvalues</h3>

<p>
  This solution seems the one that is chosen by clang. It is probably
  the easiest to specify. Some clarification should be added to the
  standard, though.
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  6.5.2.2, add after p1: The type of a function call is the return
  type of the function without any qualifiers.
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  6.5.4, add after p2: The type of a cast expression of a qualified
  scalar type is the scalar type without any qualifiers.
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  6.7.63, change p15, first sentence: For two function types to be
  compatible, the unqualified versions of both return types shall be
  compatible.
</p>

<h3>Add a <code>const</code> qualifier to all types for rvalues</h3>

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   This solution seems the one that is chosen by clang. It is probably -->
<!--   the easiest to specify. Some clarification should be added to the -->
<!--   standard, though. -->
<!-- </p> -->

<p class="alternative">
  6.5.2.2, add after p1: The type of a function call is
  the <code>const</code>-qualified return
  type of the function without any other qualifiers.
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  6.5.4, add after p2: The type of a cast expression of a qualified
  scalar type is the <code>const</code>-qualified scalar type without
  any other qualifiers.
</p>

The third addedum would be the same as in the previous case:

<p class="alternative">
  6.7.63, change p15, first sentence: For two function types to be
  compatible, the unqualified versions of both return types shall be
  compatible.
</p>

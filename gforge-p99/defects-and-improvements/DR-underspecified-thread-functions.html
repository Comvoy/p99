<h1>Defect Report relative to n1570: underspecification of thread
  functions with void return</h1>

<h2>Problem statement</h2>

<p>
  There is are several thread functions in C11 that don't provide
  return values:
  <code>call_once</code>,
  <code>cnd_destroy</code>,
  <code>mtx_destroy</code>,
  <code>tss_delete</code>, and
  <code>thrd_yield</code>.
  These functions can never fail.
</p>

<p>
  On the other it is easily imaginable that for given implementations
  there might be conditions that have these functions fail. In
  particular first four refer to objects or structures of some kind
  and have to suppose that these are valid. The standard in these
  cases gives no possibility to the functions to return an eventual
  detection of such a bad state. It doesn't even mention that calling
  these functions with invalid data can lead to undefined behavior.
</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>


<h3>Importance of compatibility with other thread interfaces</h3>
<p>
  POSIX threads have return types for the corresponding calls that may
  return valuable information to the application. Wrappers around
  POSIX threads currently have to ignore that information and are not
  able to return it, nor are they allowed to output a runtime
  diagnostic or to abort the program.
</p>

<p>
  Implementations of C11 threads that use POSIX threads underneath in
  a shallow interface (e.g through <code>inline</code> functions) may
  face multiple warnings from compilers or code analysers about
  ignored return values.
</p>

<h3>Importance of the possibility of failure</h3>
<p>
  It is unlikely that an implementation will be able to implement
  these functions in way that guarantees their successful invocation
  under all circumstances. The standard not being precise on the
  possible conditions for failure opens the door to a great variety of
  behavior of these calls in such a case. It is possible that that
  variety of strategies to cope with errors is unavoidable, but the
  standard should at least note the most common conditions and force
  implementation defined behavior in these cases.
</p>

<h2>Proposed solutions</h2>
<p>
  There are basically two main strategies to overcome that
  difficulty. The first is to change the interfaces and to allow them
  to return an <code>int</code>-error code. The second to specify for
  each call under what circumstances the behavior becomes undefined.
</p>

<p>
  Both solutions require an analysis of the conditions under which
  these functions may fail. Fortunately, POSIX also provides us with
  such an analysis so the text could be more or less copied from
  there.
</p>

  <code>call_once</code>,

<p class="alternative">
 The behavior of <code>call_once</code> is undefined if <code>flag</code>
 has automatic storage duration or is not initialized by
 <code>ONCE_FLAG_INIT<code>.
</p>

  <code>cnd_destroy</code>,

<p class="alternative">
  A destroyed condition variable object can be reinitialized
  using <code>cnd_init</code>; the results of otherwise referencing
  the object after it has been destroyed are undefined.<br />

  It shall be safe to destroy an initialized condition variable object
  upon which no threads are currently blocked. Attempting to destroy a
  condition variable object upon which other threads are currently
  blocked results in failure of the call.
</p>

  <code>mtx_destroy</code>,

<p class="alternative">
  A destroyed mutex object can be reinitialized
  using <code>mtx_init</code>; the results of otherwise referencing
  the object after it has been destroyed are undefined.<br />

  Attempting to destroy a locked mutex or one that is referenced by
  another thread that is blocked in a call to <code>cnd_wait</code>
  results in failure of the call.
</p>

<code>tss_delete</code>,

<p class="alternative">
  Any attempt to use <code>key</code> following the call to
  <code>tss_delete</code> results in failure of the call.
</p>

<p>
  Then, the two alternatives would be to add either of the two
  following snipets to the sections for each of the functions:
</p>

UB
<p class="alternative">
  A failing call results in undefined behavior.
</p>

change return type
<p class="alternative">
  ... change the return type to int ...<br />

  An implementation should specify if it is able to handle failures
  and what error indications are returned in such a case by the
  function. If a particular implementation isn't able to handle
  failures the behavior becomes undefined.
</p>

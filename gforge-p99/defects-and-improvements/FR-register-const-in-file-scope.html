  Feature Request: introduce <em>named
    constants</em> as <code>const</code>-qualified objects
  with <code>register</code> storage class
</h1>

<h2>Problem statement</h2>

<p>
  Data types that we declare in C often have some common values that
  should be shared by all users of that type. Most prominent in C is
  the all zero initialized value that we always can enforce trough a
  default initializer of a <code>static</code> object, others need
  detailed initializers:
</p>

<pre>
typedef struct listElem listElem;
struct listElem { unsigned val; listElem* next; };
static listElem const singleton = { 0 };
static listElem const singleOne = { .val = 1 };
</pre>

<p>
  There are two ways to deal with such <code>const</code> qualified
  objects in file scope. If they are implemented as above
  with <code>static</code> storage class, the may result in one object
  per compilation unit and the compiler might throw spooky warnings on
  us if we define them in a header file but don't use them at all.
</p>

<p>
  Another way is to declare them <code>extern</code> in a header file
</p>

<pre>
extern listElem const singleton;
</pre>

<p>
  and to define them in one of the compilation units:
</p>

<pre>
listElem const singleton = { 0 };
</pre>

<p>
  This second method has the big disadvantage that the value of the
  object is not available in the other units that include the
  declaration. Therefore we may miss some opportunities for the
  compiler to optimize our code. For example an initialization
  function for our structure type may be written as
</p>

<pre>
inline
listElem* listElem_init(listElem* el) {
 if (el) *el = singleton;
 return el;
}
</pre>

<p>
  If the value of <code>singleOne</code> is known, the assignment
  could be realized without loading it but only with immediats. And
  <code>listElem_init</code> itself could then much easier be inlined
  where it is called.
</p>

<p>
  C currently has no real support for global constants for arbitrary
  data types, not even for all of the standard arithmetic types: all
  integer constants are at least as large as <code>int</code>. For
  scalar types a cast can be used to produce a value expression:
</p>
<pre>
#define myVeritableFalse ((_Bool)+0)
#define myVeritableTrue ((_Bool)+1)
#define HELLO ((char const*const)"hello")
</pre>

<p>
  Or some predefined macro for the special case of complex types:
</p>
<pre>
#define ORIGIN CMPLXF(0, 0)
</pre>

<p>
  The only named constants that can serve as genuine constant
  expressions as C understands it are of type <code>int</code> and are
  declared through a declaration of an enumeration:
</p>

<pre>
enum { uchar_upper = ((unsigned)UCHAR_MAX) + 1, };
</pre>

<p>
  All this, to just define a constant; we thereby define a new type (the unnamed
  enumeration type) and define a constant that isn't even of that
  type, but an <code>int</code>.
</p>

<p>
  For composite types, in particular structure types, the only way to
  fabric a value expression that is not an assignable lvalue and such
  that the address can't be taken is to first define
  an object for the desired type and to feed it into an expression
  such that the result is an rvalue. The only operator that can return
  a composite type as a whole is the assignment operator:
</p>

<pre>
#define SINGLETON ((listElem){ .val = 0, next = 0, } = (listElem const){ .val = 0, next = 0, })
</pre>

<p>
  Such expression can be hard to read for a human and a debugger; we
  have to use two compound literals to create a simple rvalue, one
  that may be <code>const</code>-qualified where the other can't.
  The biggest disadvantage is that such an expression is not suitable for
  initializers for objects with static storage duration. We'd have to
  define two different macros, one for the initializer and one for the
  constant expression:
</p>

<pre>
#define SINGLETON_INIT { .val = 0, next = 0, }
#define SINGLETON_MOD_LVALUE (listElem){ .val = 0, next = 0, }
#define SINGLETON_CONST_LVALUE (listElem const){ .val = 0, next = 0, }
#define SINGLETON (SINGLETON_MOD_LVALUE = SINGLETON_CONST_LVALUE)
</pre>

<p>
  In block scope, on the other hand, there is a construct that can be
  used to declare unmutable values of which no address can be
  taken: <code>const</code>-qualified objects
  with <code>register</code> storage class. All the above could be
  given in block scope with functionally equivalent definitions:
</p>

<pre>
register const listElem singleton = { 0 };
register const listElem singleOne = { .val = 1 };
register const _Bool myVeritableFalse = 0;
register const _Bool myVeritableTrue = 1;
register const char *const HELLO = "hello";
register const float _Complex ORIGIN = CMPLXF(0, 0);
register const int uchar_upper = (unsigned)UCHAR_MAX + 1;
register const listElem SINGLETON = { .val = 0, next = 0, };
</pre>

<p>
  The idea of this proposal is that there is no apparent reason that
  these <code>register</code> definitions couldn't be allowed in file
  scope.
</p>

<h2>Proposed modification</h2>

<p>
  The aim of this proposal is to introduce <em>named constants</em>,
  that are values that are referred through an identifier, by
  means <code>const</code>-qualified objects
  with <code>register</code> storage class. Since this construct
  already exists in block scope, only two features must be introduced
  to make this concept suitable for the intended use:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Allow the definition of <code>const</code>-qualified objects
    with <code>register</code> storage class in file scope.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow the usage of <code>const</code>-qualified objects
    with <code>register</code> storage class in constant expressions.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
  Allow the usage of <code>const</code>-qualified objects
  with <code>register</code> storage class in constant expressions.
</h3>

<p>
  We have to add a new item to the list of valid constants in 6.4.4
  (and in the appendix)
</p>

<pre  class="alternative">
constant:
	integer-constant
	floating-constant
	enumeration-constant
	character-constant
	named-constant
</pre>

<p>
  Then add a new section 6.4.4.5:
</p>


<p class="alternative">
6.4.4.3 Named constants<br />
Syntax<br />
1 named-constant: identifier<br />
Semantics<br />
2 An identifier of <code>register</code>
storage class and of type that is <code>const</code> qualified with no
other qualification, that is not a VM type, and such that its
initializer is build only with constant expressions is a <em>named
    constant</em>.
<p>

<p>
  It would also be appropriate to add an explanatory footnote, here.
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  XX) A named constant is such that its value and size are entirely
  determined at compile time. Because it must be initialized it cannot
  be a VLA. The additional constraint of not being a VM type is
  necessary to ensure that all uses in constant expressions will
  indeed be constant.
</p>


<p>
  Add a paragraph (between the current p5 and p6) that explains how
  named constants can be used in subexpressions.
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  A <em>named constant expression</em> shall be a named constant
  optionally followed by a designator list.
</p>

<p>
  In the examples above, the following are valid named constant
  expressions:
</p>

<pre>
singleton
singleOne.val
Hello[myVeritableTrue]
</pre>

The first is of type <code>struct listElem</code> and with default
initialized value for that type; the second is of type <code>unsigned
int</code> and value <code>0</code>; the third is of type <code>char
const</code> and value <code>'e'</code>.

<p>
  Then we have to add named constants to be valid integer constant
  expressions in 6.6. Add to p6 before "integer constants,":
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  named constant expressions of integer type,
</p>

<p>
  and to p7 add as a first list item:
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  - a named constant expression
</p>

<p>
  Optionally, we could also add suitable compound literals to that
  list; gcc already has an extension that allows for this.
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  - a compound literal that is <code>const</code> qualified with no
  other qualification and such that its initializer is build only with
  constant expressions, optionally followed by a designator list.
</p>

<p>
  Add to p8 before "integer constants,":
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  named constants expressions of arithmetic type,
</p>

<p>
  Modify p9 at the end of the first sentence:
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  ... or implicitly by the use of an expression of array or function
  type, or by the value of a named constant expression.
</p>

<h3>
  Allow the definition of <code>const</code>-qualified objects
  with <code>register</code> storage class in file scope.
</h3>

<p>
In 6.9 replace p2:
</p>

<p  class="alternative">
  The storage-class specifier <code>auto</code> shall not appear in
  the declaration specifier in an external declaration.  If the
  storage-class specifier <code>register</code> appears in the
  declaration specifier of an external declaration it shall be the
  definition of a named constant.
<p>


<p>
  In 6.3.2.1p3 add to the list of exceptional cases
</p>

<p  class="alternative">
  or it occurs inside a named constant expression
<p>

<p>
  and add named constant expressions to the "Forward references" at
  the end:
</p>
<p  class="alternative">
  named constant expression (6.4.4.5)
<p>

<p>
  In section 6.7.1 there is a footnote that explains the potential
  implementation and use of <code>register</code> objects.
</p>
<p  class="alternative">
  121) The implementation simply may treat any register declaration in block
  scope as an auto declaration and in file scope as static
  declaration.<br />
  ... ...<br />
  Thus, the only operators that can be applied to an array declared
  with storage-class specifier register
  are <code>sizeof</code>, <code>_Alignof</code> or array designators
  if the array is the obtained as the value of a named constant
  expression (6.4.4.5).
</p>

<p>
  Optionally, in section 6.7.6.2 "Array declarators" p2 emphasize
  that <code>register</code> storage class in file scope implies that
  VLA are not allowed. Add a footnote for that:
</p>
<p  class="alternative">
  xx) Thus a file scope named constant can not have a variable length
  array type, because it has static storage duration. It also can't be
  of another VM type, because in file scope there exists no constant
  identifier of VM type that could be used for its initialization.
</p>


  <h2>
    Discussion
  </h2>

  <h3>
    Validity
  </h3>
<p>
  Clearly the above modifications do not invalidate any valid program
  under the current standard. They only assure that some formally
  invalid programs become valid.
</p>

<p>
  For <code>register</code> objects in block scope, the only
  semantic change wouldn't be that some of these objects now would be
  considered to be constant expressions, and thus be allowed in some contexts where
  they weren't before. In particular, some array bounds of block scope
  arrays might now become constant and thus an array that previously
  was a VLA might now be an ordinary array. Such a shift only enables
  more flexibility (by allowing initializers) and extends in some
  cases the life time of an array.
</p>

<p>
  <code>Register</code> objects in file scope were not permitted
  before. So here there will be no change for existing conforming
  programs.
</p>

<p>
  The impact on the allowed grammar is minimal. The only new case is
  the definition of an identifier in file scope, where now also
  storage class specifier <code>register</code> may occur, but this
  only if the type is <code>const</code> qualified in addition.
</p>
<p>
  For the semantic of constant expressions this adds named constants
  followed by designators to the possibilities.
</p>
<p>
  For the semantic of integer constant expressions this adds some
  expressions of integer type that contain named constants followed by
  designators to the possibilities that correspond to fields of
  integer type.
</p>
<p>
  For the semantic of <em>integer constant expressions</em>
  or <em>arithmetic constant expressions</em> this adds some
  expressions of integer type that contain named constants followed by
  designators to the possibilities that correspond to fields of
  integer type.
</p>
<p>
  This doesn't add new types of <em>address constants</em> since the
  address of <code>register</code> objects can't be taken.
</p>

<h3>New file scope objects</h3>

<p>
  The main new feature that is added by this proposal are a restricted
  class of <code>register</code> objects in file scope, namely those
  that have a <code>const</code>-qualified type. Since not much of the
  rest of the description of file scope objects is changed,
  such <code>const</code> qualified objects would have the following
  properties:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    They have "external" linkage.
  </li>
  <li>
    They have of static storage duration.
  </li>
  <li>
    Taking the address of such an object would be a constraint
    violation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Such an object is not a modifiable lvalue.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since the proposal requires that all declarations are also
    definitions, there can actually only exactly one such definition.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the definition has no initializer the object is default
    initialized just as other objects of static storage duration.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there is an initializer, it must only contain constant
    expressions as partial initializer expressions and for
    designators.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Modifying an object that is defined
  with <code>const</code>-qualified type would always be undefined
  behavior, but if the object would be <code>register</code> such a
  modification could slip in when the program is executed. With this
  proposal we would even have a stronger property, namely that a
  modification could only happen through a constraint violation (and
  thus require a compile time diagnostic):
</p>

<p>
  Because of 4. it can never be on the left side of an assignment
  operator or the operand of an increment operator. A cast never leads
  to an lvalue. Property 3. ensures that the lvalue can never be
  accessed through a different type.
</p>


<p>
  Property 1. is desirable to oblige users of this feature to use the
  identifier that corresponds to a named constant consistently. It
  doesn't oblige and implementation to provide a symbol in the sense
  of the linker program of the platform, but it provides the
  possibility to do so.
</p>

<h3>Possible realizations</h3>

<h4>
  The C++ way
</h4>

<p>
  C++ already went part of the path that is proposed here. It allows
  definitions of <code>const</code>-qualified integer typed objects in
  file scope, if the initializer is a constant integer
  expression. This is made in such a way that no linkage conflicts
  occurs and that these "constants" in turn can occur in constant
  integer expressions.
</p>

<p>
  This model only fits half into what we want to achieve, here. First
  C++ has these objects also as external symbol and enables the
  programmer to take the address of it; C++ often needs references of
  values. Then this is restricted to integer typed constants, which is
  much less than is desirable.
</p>

<h4>
  Treat named constants similar to objects with internal linkage
</h4>
<p>
  As mentioned in the modified footnote 121) the simplest possible
  realization of named constants in file scope is to treat them the
  same as <code>static</code> <code>const</code> qualified
  objects. If the compiler is not able to optimize all uses of that
  object into immediates, this realization may have the disadvantage
  that each compilation unit gets its own copy of this object.
</p>

<p>
  Such a realization would never lead to unspecific behavior. The only
  unspecific behavior that several realizations as objects with
  internal linkage would imply, is that the addresses of these objects
  would be different. Since the address of such an object can't be
  taken, the properties of having the same address (or not) would not
  be observable.
</p>

<p>
  A test macro code in P99, <code>P99_CONSTANT</code> that just
  declares a <code>static</code> <code>const</code> qualified object
  and assures that the compiler cannot issue useless warnings about
  an unused identifier shows good results: with optimization enabled,
  gcc and clang both are able to avoid the allocation of the object
  and use only its value where appropriate. Obviously, such
  replacement macro cannot test if the address of such an object is
  taken, but hopefully the implementation of this feature for block
  scope <code>register</code> objects could easily be reused.
</p>

<h4>
  Treat named constants similar to objects with "weak" linkage
</h4>

<p>
  Another possibility for a realization is to use a common extension
  that introduces "weak" linkage, i.e a linkage property that allows
  for multiple definition of an object in different compilation
  units. If several such objects occur in different units, the linker
  then asserts that all are of the same size and arbitrarily chooses
  one of these for the final program.
</p>

<p>
  This technique is e.g already used by some compiler implementors to
  realize inline functions. gcc and clang also handle this approach
  well. But in difference to the previous approach they always
  generate an object, so a final program will always contain exactly
  one copy of each named constant.

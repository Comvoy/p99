<h1>Feature Request: unary <code>+</code> for rvalue conversion of
  arbitrary types</h1>

<h2>Problem statement</h2>

<p>
  To use generic selection primary expressions comfortably it would
  be convenient to have a possibility to perform some sort of lvalue
  to rvalue conversion to the controlling expression:
</p>
<pre>
#define cbrt(X)        \
_Generic(+(X),         \
  long double: cbrtl,  \
  default: cbrt,       \
  float: cbrtf         \
)(X)
</pre>

<p>
  Under the assumption that types of rvalues are always unqualified,
  here the prefix operator <code>+</code> in the selection expression
  ensures that lvalue conversion on arithmetic types is performed such
  that e.g lvalues of type <code>float const</code>
  select <code>cbrtf</code> and not the
  default <code>cbrt</code>. Otherwise, for the same effect, the
  generic association list would have to list all 8 qualified version
  of <code>long double</code> and <code>float</code>, respectively.
</p>

<p>
  For programming with type generic expressions it would be convenient
  to have a generic tool that allows to drop qualifiers in same spirit
  as for <code>cbrt</code> above:
</p>
<pre>
#define LOCK(X)           \
_Generic(UNQUALIFY(*(X)), \
  mtx_t: mtx_lock,        \
  sem_t: sem_wait,        \
)(X)
</pre>

<p>
  In the current version of the standard there is no generic tool that
  would transform an lvalue of any type into an rvalue expression of
  the same type or that would allow to drop all qualifiers from the
  type. There are only partial solutions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    for arithmetic types other
    than <code>_Bool</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>short</code>:
    apply unary <code>+</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    for scalar types other
    than <code>_Bool</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>short</code>:
    apply binary <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> with other
    operand <code>0</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The later form can be used to cook a generic expression that results
  in an appropriate rvalue for all scalar types.
</p>

<pre>
#define UNQUALIFY_SCALAR(X) _Generic((X),              \
  default: (X)+0,                                      \
  _Bool: (_Bool)(X),                                   \
  _Bool const: (_Bool)(X),                             \
  _Bool volatile: (_Bool)(X),                          \
  _Bool const volatile: (_Bool)(X),                    \
  _Bool _Atomic: (_Bool)(X),                           \
  _Bool _Atomic const: (_Bool)(X),                     \
  _Bool _Atomic volatile: (_Bool)(X),                  \
  _Bool _Atomic const volatile: (_Bool)(X),            \
   ... same expansion for the other narrow types ...   \
)
</pre>

<p>
  This expression has to cover all possible combinations of qualifiers
  for all the 6 narrow integer types, that is in total 48 special
  cases.
</p>

<p>
  For our example of <code>LOCK</code> currently no generic
  implementation of an <code>UNQUALIFY</code> macro is known. So
  instead to implement <code>LOCK</code> 16 different cases would be
  needed in the selection list. Coding such type generic expression
  systematically in production code is difficult to maintain and such
  enumerative solutions observably increase compilation times.
</p>


<h2>Proposed modification</h2>

<p>
Replace the beginning of 6.5.3.3 by the following
</p>

<p  class="alternative">
6.5.3.3 Unary arithmetic operators
<br />
Constraints
<br />
The operand of the unary <code>-</code> operator shall have arithmetic
type; of the <code>~</code> operator, integer type; of
the <code>!</code>  operator, scalar type.
<p>

<p>
  Add a new section for the unary <code>+</code> operator:
</p>

<p  class="alternative">
6.5.3.X The unary <code>+</code> operator
<br />
Semantics
<br />

If the operand of the unary <code>+</code> operator is not of an array
type, the result shall be the value of its operand with a result type
that is the unqualified type of its operand. If it is of array type,
the operand shall first undergo an array to pointer conversion
(6.3.2.1p3).
</p>

<p>
  <b>C all previous standards:</b> For expression that use the
  unary <code>+</code> operator outside type generic expression this
  modification slightly changes the order in which type promotion is
  effected in the abstract machine. Whereas before that modification a
  promotion (e.g of <code>short</code> to <code>int</code>) would have
  occurred prior to an application of the operator, with this
  modification the promotion would only be performed on the result of
  the <code>+</code> operator once it is itself the operand of another
  operator. This difference is not be observable by any program,
  unless it uses a <code>_Generic</code> primary expression.
</p>

<p>
  <b>C11:</b> When used in <code>_Generic</code> primary expressions
  the difference would become observable by a program. But expressions
  that knowingly use a <code>+</code> operator, e.g to force a type
  promotion, should be marginal.

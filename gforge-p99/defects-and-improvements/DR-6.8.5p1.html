<h1>Defect Report relative to n1570: 6.8.5p1 and A.2.3</h1>

<h2>Problem statement</h2>

<p>
The standard lists two different forms for
the <code>for</code>-statement in 6.8.5p1:
</p>
<pre>
for ( expression[opt] ; expression[opt] ; expression[opt] ) statement
for ( declaration expression[opt] ; expression[opt] ) statement
</pre>

<p>whereas later in 6.8.5.3 these two forms are subsumed in a third form
by:
</p>
<pre>
for ( clause-1 ; expression-2 ; expression-3 ) statement
</pre>

<p>Obviously the second form above is a typo and doesn't fit within this
third form, the semantic that is given in 6.8.5.3 and to common
practice in existing compilers.
</p>
<h2>Proposed solution</h2>

<p>
Replace the second form in 6.8.5p1 and A.2.3 by the intended one:
</p>
<pre>
for ( declaration expression[opt] ; expression[opt] ; expression[opt] ) statement
</pre>

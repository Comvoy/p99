<h2>Minimal suggested corrigendum for arithmetic on atomic objects</h2>

  <p><b>Summary</b></p>


<p>
  This is a follow up on document n1955 (DR 486) that revealed several
  inconsistencies concerning the write up of arithmetic operations for
  atomic types in the standard. For the sake of brevity I will not
  repeat that discussion here, for the complete discussion please see
  the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1955.htm">original
  document</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Already in the first document I proposed to act on these problems in
  two steps.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Suggest a minimal corrigendum that can be included in the next
  "bugfix" revision of the C standard</li>
  <li>Continue the discussion for C2x
    <ul><li>to extend the type generic functions
        to more types</li>
      <li>to eventually add other type generic functions for all
        read-modify-write operators</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  During discussion the committee found that the minimal corrigendum
  that I suggested was already too intrusive such that it easily could
  estimate the impact on the rest of the document. This document here
  is an attempt to reduce that proposal even more to make changes that
  merely obvious.
</p>

<p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum</b><br/></p>

<p><b>5.1.2.4 p5</b>, the text omits operators for the discussion as
  synchronization operations. change the beginning:</p>

<p class="quote">
  The <span class="strike">library defines</span> a number
  of atomic operations <span class="strike">(7.17)</span> and
  operations on mutexes (7.26.4) that are specially identified as
  synchronization operations.
</p>

<p>to</p>

<p class="quote">
  The <span class="alternative">language and the library define</span>
  a number of atomic operations <span class="alternative">(6.2.6.1,
  6.5.16 and 7.17)</span>
  and operations on mutexes (7.26.4) that are specially identified as
  synchronization operations.
</p>


<p><b>6.2.6.1 p9</b>, for clarification replace:</p>

<p class="quote">
 <span class="strike">Loads and stores of</span> objects with atomic
 types are done with <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> semantics.
</p>

<p>
  by the following
</P>

<p class="quote">
  <span class="alternative">Unless specified otherwise, all operations
 that affect</span> objects with atomic types are done with
 <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code> semantics.
</p>

<p>
  <b>7.17.7 p1</b>, the discussion omits operators and uses the term
  "kind of operations" where it should simply speak of "generic
  functions". Replace
</p>

<p class="quote">
  There are only a few <span class="strike">kinds of operations on
  atomic types, though there are many instances of those
  kinds</span>. This subclause specifies each <span class="strike">general kind</span>.
</p>

<p>
  by
</p>

<p class="quote">
  <span class="alternative">In addition to the operators that are
  defined for atomic objects,</span> there are a
  few <span class="alternative">operations that are specified as
  generic functions</span>. This subclause specifies
  each <span class="alternative">generic function</span>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>7.17.7.5</b> needs changes in p1, p3 and p5.
</p>

<p>
  <b>p1</b>, this paragraph misses pointer types as valid
  operands. Since only "add" and "sub" should be used for pointer
  types, also add a mention which operations are valid. Change:
</p>

<p class="strike">
  ... to an object of any atomic integer type. None of these
  operations is applicable to <code>atomic_bool</code>
</p>

<p>
  to
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  ... to an object of any atomic integer or pointer type, as long as
   type <code>C</code> is valid for the left operand of the
   corresponding operator <code>op=</code>.FOOTNOTE<br/> <br/>

  FOOTNOTE: Thus none of these operations are permitted
  if <code>C</code> is <code>_Bool</code>, and only "add" and "sub"
  variants are permitted if <code>C</code> is a pointer type.
</p>

<p>
  <b>p3</b> clarify "<em>no undefined</em>". Even if arithmetic
  silently wraps around the result can be a trap representation, and
  generally address operations can be erroneous for different
  reasons. Replace:
</p>

<p class="quote">
  For signed integer types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s
  complement representation with silent wrap-around on overflow
  <span class="strike">; there are no undefined
  results</span>. For <span class="strike">address</span> types, the
  result may be an <span class="strike">undefined address</span>, but
  the operations otherwise have no <span class="strike">undefined
  behavior</span>.
</p>

<p>by</p>

<p class="quote">
  For signed integer types, arithmetic is defined to use two’s
  complement representation with silent wrap-around on
  overflow. <span class="alternative">If the corresponding operation
  for type <code>C</code> is erroneous, the result and stored
  representation may not be a valid value for <code>C</code></span>,
  but the operation otherwise has no <span class="alternative">visible
  effect</span>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>p5</b> is non-normative but factually wrong and misleading. One
  solution could be to remove the entire NOTE, or to replace:
</p>

<p class="quote">
  The <span class="strike">only</span> differences are that
  the <span class="strike">compound assignment operators are not
  guaranteed to operate atomically</span>, and the value yielded by a
  compound assignment operator is the updated value of the object,
  whereas the value returned by the atomic_fetch and modify generic
  functions is the previous value of the atomic object.
</p>

<p>
  by
</p>

<p class="quote">
  The differences are that
  the <span class="alternative"><code>order</code> parameter may make
  the memory consistency less strict
  than <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>, <code>*object</code>
  is <code>volatile</code> qualified, the effect of
  updating <code>*object</code> is sequenced with respect to the
  call</span>, and the value yielded by a compound assignment operator
  is the updated value of the object, whereas the value returned by
  the atomic_fetch and modify generic functions is the previous value
  of the atomic object.

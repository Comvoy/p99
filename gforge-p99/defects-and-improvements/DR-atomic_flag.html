<h1>Defect Report relative to n1570: initialization of atomic types,
  including <code>atomic_flag</code></h1>

<h2>Problem statement</h2>

<p>
  C11 expresses the intention to have <code>atomic_flag</code> as a primitive that
  should allow to emulate all other atomic types and
  operations, <em>7.17.8 p3</em> in a note says:
</p>

<p class="quote">
  The remaining types can be emulated with <code>atomic_flag</code>,
  though with less than ideal properties.
</p>

<p>
  This is a very good concept as far as I can see, but I have one
  problem to achieve this, initialization. The phrasing for atomic
  types in general and for <code>atomic_flag</code> are different.
  For <code>atomic_flag</code> we have:
</p>

<p class="quote">
  An atomic_flag that is not explicitly initialized with
  <code>ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT</code> is initially in an indeterminate
  state.
</p>

<p>For other atomic types we have:</p>

<p class="quote">
  An atomic object with automatic storage duration that is not
  explicitly initialized using <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> is
  initially in an indeterminate state; however, the default (zero)
  initialization for objects with static or thread-local storage
  duration is guaranteed to produce a valid state.
</p>

<p>
  This has two problems. First, the mentioned valid state (in contrast
  to the indeterminate state mentioned before) is thus a determinate
  state, but the value that is stored is not mentioned
  explicitly. Everything suggests that this would be the same value as
  for initializing a variable of the underlying base type
  by <code>0</code>. But I think it would have helped to make that
  explicit.</p>

<p>
  The second, more difficult problem is how to emulate an atomic type
  with <code>atomic_flag</code> during initialization. Say we emulate
  with something like
</p>

<pre class="brush: cpp;">
struct atomic_int_struct {
  atomic_flag cat;
  int val;
};
</pre>
<p>
  Then the <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> macro could simply look
  like:
</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp;">
#define ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(V) { .cat = ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT, .val = (V), }
</pre>
<p>
  But if I&#8217;d have a variable of <code>atomic_int_struct</code>
  with static storage duration
</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp;">
struct atomic_int_struct v;
</pre>
<p>
  is supposed to do the right thing, namely to guarantee
  that <code>v</code> has a valid state at startup, so it should
  contain a <code>0</code> for <code>.val</code>,
  and <code>.cat</code> must be in a determinate state. Since all
  atomic operations should work without problems on <code>v</code>,
  the state of <code>.cat</code> can&#8217;t be anything else than
  &#8220;clear&#8221;.
</p>
<p>
  Now looking into the possible implementations
  of <code>atomic_flag</code> in assembler I didn&#8217;t yet meet a
  processor where the &#8220;clear&#8221; state would not be naturally
  represented by an all <code>0</code> value. So I guess in any
  reasonable implementation we would just have
</p>
<pre class="brush: cpp;">
#define ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT { 0 }
</pre>
<p>(or some equivalent formulation.)</p>
<p>
  If this is so, why <code>ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT</code> at all? Why not
  phrasing the same as for the other atomic types
</p>

<h2>Proposed solution</h2>

<p>
  Eliminate the mention of <code>ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT</code> in 7.17.1p3,
  B.16 and the index.
</p>

<p>
  Proposed change for the initialization of <code>atomic_flag</code>,
  7.17.8p4:
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  The default initializer <code>{ 0 }</code> may be used to initialize
  an <code>atomic_flag</code> to the clear
  state. An <code>atomic_flag</code> object with automatic storage
  duration that is not explicitly initialized using <code>{ 0 }</code>
  is initially in an indeterminate state; <em>however, the default
    (zero) initialization for objects with static or thread-local
    storage duration initializes an <code>atomic_flag</code> to the
    clear state.</em>
  <br />
  EXAMPLE<br />
  <code>atomic_flag guard = { 0 };</code>
</p>

<p>Proposed change for the initialization of atomic objects, 7.17.2.1p2:</p>
<p class="alternative">
  An atomic object with automatic storage duration that is not
  explicitly initialized using <code>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</code> is
  initially in an indeterminate state; however, the default (zero)
  initialization for objects with static or thread-local storage
  duration is guaranteed to produce a valid state that corresponds to
  the value of a zero initialized object of the unqualified base
  type.
  <br />
  EXAMPLE All three of the following objects initially have an
  observable value of <code>0</code>.<br />
  <code>_Atomic(unsigned) A = { 0 };</code><br />
  <code>_Atomic(unsigned) B = ATOMIC_VAR_INIT(0u);</code><br />
  <code>static _Atomic(unsigned) C;</code>

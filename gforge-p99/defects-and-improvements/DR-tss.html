<h1>Defect Report relative to n1570: underspecification of <code>tss_t</code></h1>

<h2>Problem statement</h2>


<p>
  Section 7.26.6 &#8220;Thread-specific storage functions&#8221; of
  C11 is severely underspecified since it uses terms that are not
  introduced (so far) in the context of C. This is really a pity,
  since POSIX also has <code>pthread_key_t</code> that is completely
  feature equivalent and for which the specification is much more
  complete.
</p>

<p>
  Jacob Navia had observed that at several occasions
  in <code>comp.std.c</code> but it seems that he had not got enough
  attention such that this had made it in a defect report.
</p>

<p class="quote">
  The <code>tss_create</code> function creates a thread-specific
  storage pointer with destructor <code>dtor</code>, which may be
  null.
</p>

<p>
  The main problem is that it is nowhere explained/defined what a
  destructor should be.
</p>

<h2>Proposed solution</h2>

<p>I think several paragraphs should be added after the one above:</p>

<p class="alternative">
  The effect is that for each thread that has the thread specific
  storage corresponding to <code>key</code> set to a
  value <code>x</code> that is not null, the destructor
  function <code>*dtor</code> is called with <code>dtor(x)</code>
  before the thread exits.
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  This call to <code>dtor</code> is executed in the context of the
  same thread; it is sequenced after the <code>return</code> statement
  or the call to <code>thrd_exit</code> that terminates the thread and
  before any return from <code>thrd_join</code> of a waiter for this
  same thread. If there are several thread specific storages for the
  same thread their destructor functions are called in an unspecific
  order but with a sequence point between each of these function
  calls.
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  If a destructor function for <code>key</code> issues calls
  to <code>tss_set</code>, <code>tss_get</code>
  or <code>tss_delete</code> with the same <code>key</code> the
  behavior is undefined.<br />
  <code>tss_set</code> can be used to set the value of a thread
  specific storage for a different key <code>key2</code> that had not
  been set before or that has been processed with a call to the
  corresponding destructor.
</p>


<p>
  By that the set of thread specific storages for a given thread may
  change during the execution of the corresponding destructors.
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  If after processing all tss that are active at
  the <code>return</code> of the thread function or at the end
  of <code>thrd_exit</code> there are still tss that are active the
  procedure of calling destructors is iterated. An implementation may
  bind the maximum number such of supplementary iterations
  by <code>TSS_DTOR_ITERATIONS</code>.
</p>

<p>
  A second problem is that there are two functionalities that are
  easily mixed up and which interrelationship should be clarified: the
  destructor that is called (let us suppose this) at exit of a thread,
  and <code>tss_delete</code> that deletes a thread specific storage
  for all running threads. I think something like the following should
  be added in 7.26.6.2 after para 2:
</p>

<p class="alternative">
  The deletion of <code>key</code> will not change the observable
  behavior of any of the active threads. If <code>tss_delete</code> is
  called for <code>key</code> and there is a thread that has a
  non-null value for <code>key</code> that has passed a
  terminating <code>return</code> statement or call
  to <code>thrd_exit</code> but not yet finished the processing of all
  its tss destructors, the behavior is undefined.
</p>

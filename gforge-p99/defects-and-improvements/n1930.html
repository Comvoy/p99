<h1>Controlling expression of _Generic primary expression</h1>
  <b>Author:</b> Jens Gustedt, INRIA<br>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
  This is a follow up of the now closed DR 423 which resulted in the
  clarification of the status of qualifications of rvalues.
</p>

<p>
  This defect report aims to clarify the status of the controlling
  expression of <code>_Generic</code> primary expression:
</p>

<b>
<em>
  Does the controlling expression of a <code>_Generic</code> primary
  expression undergo any type of conversion to calculate the type that
  is used to do the selection?
</em>
</b>
<p>
  Implementers have given different answers to this question; gcc
  (<em>choice 1</em> in the following) on one side and clang and IBM
  (<em>choice 2</em>) on the other side went quite opposite ways,
  resulting in severe incompatibility for <code>_Generic</code>
  expression that use qualifiers or arrays.
</p>

<pre>
char const* a = _Generic("bla", char*: "blu");                 // clang error
char const* b = _Generic("bla", char[4]: "blu");               // gcc error
char const* c = _Generic((int const){ 0 }, int: "blu");        // clang error
char const* d = _Generic((int const){ 0 }, int const: "blu");  // gcc error
char const* e = _Generic(+(int const){ 0 }, int: "blu");       // both ok
char const* f = _Generic(+(int const){ 0 }, int const: "blu"); // both error
</pre>

<p>
  The last two lines, where gcc and clang agree, points to the nature
  of the problem: gcc treats all such expressions as rvalues and does
  all applicable conversions of 6.3.2.1, that is lvalue to rvalue and
  array to pointer conversions. clang treats them as lvalues.
</p>

<h2>Problem discussion</h2>
<p>
  The problem arises to know whether or not the conversions of 6.3
  apply to the controlling expression.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>
        promotions:
      </b>
      There is no general rule to which expressions these apply, but
      their application is hard coded for the individual operators,
      where it makes reference to "its (promoted) operand".
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>
        lvalue conversion:
      </b>
      I didn't find any text that would impose lvalue conversion
      performed to the controlling expression. All wording in 6.3 is
      "some" and "may". Also it talks of "operators" and "operations",
      but <code>_Generic</code> is not an operator, but a primary
      expression. The wording in 6.5.1.1 is <em>has a type</em>
      and doesn't make any reference to type conversion.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>
        array conversion:
      </b>
      The support for array conversion is stronger. Array conversion
      has an explicit list of cases (<em>6.3.2.1 p3</em>) were an
      array is an
      <em>operand</em> where it doesn't apply. But
      <ul>
        <li>
          The case of arrays as an exception in <em>6.3.2.1 p3</em>
          doesn't list the <em>associations</em>
          of <code>_Generic</code> either, which are listed
          in <em>6.5.1.1</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is another precedent, namely <em>parenthesized
          expressions</em>, which are also not listed in <em>6.3.2.1
          p3</em> and where nobody expects an array conversion,
          either.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Integer promotions</h3>

<p>
  Applying promotions would have as an effect that we wouldn't be able
  to distinguish narrow integer types from <code>int</code>. There is
  no indication that the text implies that form or conversion, nor
  that anybody has proposed to use <code>_Generic</code> like this.
</p>

<h3>Choice 1: Consequences of lvalue conversion</h3>
<p>
  All conversion in <em>6.3.2.1 p2</em> describe what would in normal
  CS language be named the evaluation of an object. It has no
  provision to apply it to types alone.

  In particular it includes the special clause that
  uninitialized <code>register</code> variables lead to undefined
  behavior when undergoing lvalue conversion. As a consequence:
</p>

<p>
<em>
  Any lvalue conversion of a <code>register</code> variable leads to
  undefined behavior.
</em>
</p>

<p>
And thus
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <b>
      Under the hypothesis that the controlling expression undergoes
      lvalue conversion, any <code>_Generic</code> primary expression
      that uses an uninitialized <code>register</code> variable as
      controlling expression leads to undefined behavior.
    </b>
  </em>
</p>

<h3>Choice 2: Consequences not doing conversions</h3>

<p>
  In view of the resolution of DR 423 (rvalues drop qualifiers)
  using <code>_Generic</code> primary expressions with objects in
  controlling expression may have results that appear surprising.
</p>

<pre>
#define F(X) _Generic((X), char const: 0, char: 1, int: 2)
char const strc[] = "";
F(strc[0])   // -> 0
F(""[0])     // -> 1
F(+strc[0])  // -> 2
</pre>

<p>
  So the problem is here, that there is no type agnostic operator that
  results in a simple lvalue conversion for <code>char const</code>
  objects to <code>char</code>; all such operators also
  promote <code>char</code> to <code>int</code>.
</p>

<p>
  <em>
    <b>
      Under the hypothesis that the controlling expression doesn't
      undergo conversion, any <code>_Generic</code> primary expression
      that uses a qualified lvalue of narrow type <code>T</code> can't
      directly trigger the association for <code>T</code> itself.
    </b>
  </em>
</p>

<h3>non-equivalence of the two approaches</h3>

<p>
  For many areas the two approaches are feature equivalent, that is
  both allow to implement the same semantic concepts, but with
  different syntax. Rewriting code that was written with one of
  choices in mind to the other choice is in general not straight
  forward and probably can't be automated.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Code that was written with <em>choice 1</em> in mind (enforced
      lvalue and array conversion) when translated to <em>choice
      2</em> has to enforce such conversions. E.g as long as we know
      that the type of <code>X</code> is only a wide integer type or
      an array or pointer type, a macro such as
      <pre>
        #define bla(X) _Generic((X), ... something ... )
      </pre>
      would have to become
      <pre>
        #define bla(X) _Generic((X)+0, ... something ... )
      </pre>
      Writing code that takes care of narrow integer types is a bit
      more difficult, but can be done with 48 extra case selections,
      taking care of all narrow types (6) and all their possible
      qualifications (8, <code>restrict</code> is not possible,
      here). Code that uses <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code>
      types must use bizarre things like <code>1 ? (X) : (X)</code> to
      enforce lvalue conversion.
      <pre>
        #define blaOther((X),                                  \
          char: blub, char const: blub, ...,                   \
          short: ...,                                          \
          default: _Generic(1 ? (X) : (X), struct toto: ... )

        #define bla(X) _Generic((X)+0, ... something ... ,     \
          default: blaOther(X))
      </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      Code that was written with <em>choice 2</em> in mind (no lvalue
      or array conversion) when translated to <em>choice 1</em> has to
      pass to a setting where qualifiers and arrays are preserved in
      the type. The only such setting is the address-of
      operator <code>&amp;</code>.
      <pre>
        #define blu(X) _Generic((X), \
           char const: blub,         \
           char[4]: blob,            \
           ...)
      </pre>
      has to be changed to something like
      <pre>
        #define blu(X) _Generic(&(X),\
          char const*: blub,         \
          char(*)[4]: blob,          \
          ...)
      </pre>
      That is each individual type selection has to be transformed,
      and the syntactical change that is to be apply is no simple
      textual replacement.
  </ul>
</p>


<h2>Application work around</h2>

<p>
  Since today C implementations have already taken different paths for
  this feature, applications should be careful when
  using <code>_Generic</code> to remain in the intersection of these
  two interpretations. A certain number of design questions should be
  answered when implementing a type generic macro:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Do I want to differentiate the outcome according to the
      qualification of the argument?
    </li>
    <li>
      Do I want to distinguish arrays from pointer arguments?
    </li>
    <li>
      Do I want to distinguish narrow types?
    </li>
    <li>
      Do I want to apply it to composite types,
      namely <code>struct</code> types?
    </li>
  </ul>
  The following lists different strategies for common scenarios, that
  can be used to code type generic macros that will work with both of
  the choices 1 or 2.
</p>

<h3>Wide integers and floating point types</h3>

<p>
  This is e.g the case of the C library interfaces
  in <tt>&lt;tgmath.h&gt;</tt>.  If we know that the possible type of
  the argument is restricted in such a way, the easiest is to apply
  the unary plus operator <code>+</code>, as in
</p>

<pre>
  #define F(X) _Generic(+(X),             \
    default: doubleFunc,                  \
    int: intFunc,                         \
    ...                                   \
    _Complex long double: cldoubleFunc)(X)

  #define fabs(X) _Generic(+(X),          \
    default: fabs,                        \
    float: fabsf,                         \
    long double: fabsl)(X)
</pre>
<p>
This <code>+</code> sign ensures an lvalue to rvalue conversion, and,
that it will error out at compilation time for pointer types or
arrays. It also forcibly promotes narrow integer types, usually
to <code>int</code>. For the later case of <code>fabs</code> all
integer types will map to the <code>double</code> version of the
function, and the argument will eventually be converted
to <code>double</code> before the call is made.
</p>
<h3>Adding pointer types and converting arrays</h3>

<p>
  If we also want to capture pointer types <em>and</em> convert arrays
  to pointers, we should use <code>+0</code>.
</p>

<pre>
  #define F(X) _Generic((X)+0),           \
    default: doubleFunc,                  \
    char*: stringFunc,                    \
    char const*: stringFunc,              \
    int: intFunc,                         \
    ...                                   \
    _Complex long double: cldoubleFunc)(X)
</pre>

<p>
This binary <code>+</code> ensures that any array is first converted
to a pointer; the properties of <code>0</code> ensure that this
constant works well with all the types that are to be captured, here.
It also forcibly promotes narrow integer types, usually
to <code>int</code>.</p>

<h3>Converting arrays, only</h3>

<p>
  If we k now that a macro will only be used for array and pointer
  types, we can use the <code>[]</code> operator:
</p>

<pre>
  #define F(X) _Generic(&((X)[0]),        \
    char*: stringFunc,                    \
    char const*: stringFunc,              \
    wchar_t*: wcsFunc,                    \
    ...                                   \
    )(X)
</pre>

<p>
  This operator only applies to array or to pointer types and would
  error if present with any integer type.
</p>

<h3>Using qualifiers of types or arrays</h3>

<p>
  If we want a macro that selects differently according to type
  qualification or according to different array size, we can use
  the <code>&</code> operator:
</p>

<pre>
  #define F(X) _Generic(&(X),        \
    char**: stringFunc,              \
    char(*)[4]: string4Func,         \
    char const**: stringFunc,        \
    char const(*)[4]: string4Func,   \
    wchar_t**: wcsFunc,              \
    ...                              \
    )(X)
</pre>


<h2>Possible solutions</h2>

<p>
The above discussion describes what can be read from the text of C11,
alone, and not the intent of the committee. I think if the committee
would have wanted a <em>choice 2</em>, the standard text would not
have looked much different than what we have, now. Since also the
intent of the committee to go for <em>choice 1</em> seems not to be
very clear from any additional text (minutes of the meetings, e.g) I
think the reading of <em>choice 2</em> should be the preferred one.
</p>

<p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum (any choice)</b><br>

<p>
  Amend the list in footnote 121 for objects
  with <code>register</code> storage class. Change
</p>

<p  class="quote">
 Thus, the only operators that can be applied to an array declared
with storage-class specifier <code>register</code>
are <code>sizeof</code> and <code>_Alignof</code>.
</p>

<p  class="alternative">
  Thus, an identifier with array type and declared with storage-class
  specifier <code>register</code> may only appear in primary
  expressions and as operand to <code>sizeof</code>
  and <code>_Alignof</code>.
</p>


<p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum (Choice 2)</b><br>
  Change 6.5.1.1 p3, first sentence
</p>
<center  class="quote">
  The controlling expression of a generic selection is not evaluated
  <span class="alternative">and the type of that expression is used
  without applying any conversions described in Section 6.3</span>.
</center>

<p>
  Add <code>_Generic</code> to the exception list in <em>6.3.2.1
  p3</em> to make it clear that array to pointer conversion applies to
  none of the controlling or association expression if they are
  lvalues of array type.
</p>

<center  class="quote">
  Except when it is <span class="alternative">the controlling
    expression or an association expression
    of a <code>_Generic</code> primary expression, or is</span> the operand of
    the <code>sizeof</code> operator, the <code>_Alignof</code>
    operator, or the unary <code>&amp;</code> operator, or is a string
    literal used to initialize an array, an expression that has type
    ‘‘array of type’’ is converted to an expression with type
    ‘‘pointer to type’’ that points to the initial element of the
    array object and is not an lvalue. If the array object has
    register storage class, the behavior is undefined.
</center>

<p>
  Also add a forward reference to <code>_Generic</code> in 6.3.2.
</p>

<p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum (Choice 1)</b><br>

  If the intent of the committee had been <em>choice 1</em> or
  similar, bigger changes of the standard would be indicated. I only
  list some of the areas that would need changes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Move <code>_Generic</code> from primary expressions to a proper
    subsection, and rename the feature to <code>_Generic</code>
    operator.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clarify which <em>as-if</em> conversions must be applied to
    determine the type.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reformulate those conversions as conversions of types instead of
    values.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Also, add <code>_Generic</code> to the exception list in <em>6.3.2.1
  p3</em> to make it clear that array to pointer conversion applies to
  none of the association expression if they are lvalues of array type.
</p>

<center  class="quote">
  Except when it is <span class="alternative">an association expression
    of a <code>_Generic</code> expression, or is</span> the operand of
    the <code>sizeof</code> operator, the <code>_Alignof</code>

    literal used to initialize an array, an expression that has type
    ‘‘array of type’’ is converted to an expression with type
    ‘‘pointer to type’’ that points to the initial element of the
    array object and is not an lvalue. If the array object has
    register storage class, the behavior is undefined.
</center>

<p><b>Suggested Technical Corrigendum (Status quo)</b><br>

  A third possibility would be to leave this leeway to
  implementations. I strongly object to that, but if so, I would
  suggest to add a phrase to 6.5.1.1 p3 like:
</p>

<p class="quote">
  ... in the default generic
  association.  <span class="alternative">Whether or not the type of
    the controlling expression is determined as if any of conversions
    described in Section 6.3 are applied is implementation
    defined.</span>
  None of the expressions ...

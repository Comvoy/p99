<h1>Feature Request: constrain <code>const</code>-qualified variables
    with <code>register</code> storage class to be initialized</h1>

<h2>Problem statement</h2>

<p>
  Consider two <code>const</code>-qualified variables, one with
  <code>register</code> storage class and one <code>auto</code>:
</p>

<pre>
  register unsigned char const oops;
  auto unsigned char const rando;
</pre>

<p>
  Since <code>rando</code> doesn't have <code>register</code> class
  and is <code>unsigned char</code> it could always be evaluated and
  would provide an unspecific value.
</p>

<p>
  In contrast to that <code>oops</code> can never be used for other
  effects than to feed it to the <code>sizeof</code> operator. All
  other access is inhibited by the standard, either as constraint
  violation or as resulting in undefined behavior:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Because it is <code>const</code> qualified it can not be assigned
    to or otherwise modified.
  </li>
  <li>
    Because it is of <code>register</code> class, its address cannot
    be taken. So it can't even be modified indirectly by any other
    means.
  </li>
  <li>
    Because it is of <code>register</code> class and not initialized
    it cannot be evaluated.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  A compiler can easily detect that such a variable is not
  initialized at the point of the declaration itself. No complicated
  flow analysis has to be performed to see if it could have been
  initialized later or if the underlying object could have been
  aliased and then assigned with a value.
</p>


<h2>Proposed modification</h2>

<p>
After 6.7.9p5 add a new paragraph:
</p>

<p  class="alternative">
  If the declaration of an identifier has <code>register</code>
  storage class and the type of the declaration is <code>const</code>
  qualified an initialization of the object shall be provided to form
  a full definition of the object.
<p>


<p>
  If the feature request to allow for <code>const</code>-qualified
  variables with <code>register</code> storage class in file scope,
  the terminating subsentence would be important to clarify that the
  initializer is expected at any occurence of the declaration of the
  identifier and thus that there can be only exactly one
  declaration/definition of it.
</p>

<p>
  This would defer from a <code>static</code> declaration, that first
  can be given without initialization (thus being only a declaration
  and not a definition) and then later be defined by providing an
  initializer. Here a compiler could defer to establish the the value
  of the object, since he may always refer to the object through its
  address.

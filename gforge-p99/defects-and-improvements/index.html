<h1>A collection of defect reports and feature requests for C</h1>

<p>
  Here I will collect problems and a wishes that I encountered during
  the programming of (or with) C99. Don't hesitate to drop me line if
  you have remarks, precisions, additions, ... whatever.
</p>

<h2>Defects</h2>

<p>
  Here I list things that I identified as defects in the C
  standard. This may involve obviously wrong wordings or semantic
  inconsistencies.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="DR-6.8.5p1.html">Invalid grammar for the <code>for</code>-statement.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="DR-qualified-rvalues.html">underspecification for qualified rvalues</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="DR-tss.html">underspecification of <code>tss_t</code></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="DR-atomic_flag.html">initialization of <code>atomic_flag</code></a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="DR-atomic_initialization.html">initialization of atomic types</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>strcpy_s</code>, <code>strncpy_s</code>, <code>strcat_s</code>
    and <code>strncat_s</code> mention unspecified values instead of
    undetermined values: <code>signed char</code> and
    thus <code>char</code> could have trap representations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Annexe K asks for verification of non-overlapping memory ranges
    for <code>memcpy_s</code> and similar functions, which is not
    feasible without provoking UB.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="DR-underspecified-thread-functions.html">Allow all thread
    functions to return an error code.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="DR-underspecified-temporary-access-thread.html">The
    access properties for objects with temporary lifetime with respect
    to threads is not specified.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="DR-thread-interface.htm">The C thread interface is not
      realizable with threads as defined by ISO/IEC 9945:2009.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    The order on <code>uintptr_t</code> (if it is defined) given
    through the <code>&lt;</code> operator should be compatible with
    the ordering of pointers.
    <!-- This would make it possible to check if -->
    <!-- pointer ranges overlap without provoking UB. -->
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
  This will be a list of features that I think could be added to the C
  standard that I found useful. Generally the idea will be to be
  conservative (in the first sense of the word) and not to invalidate
  much existing code.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="FR-initialize-register-const.html">Constrain <code>const</code>-qualified
    variables with <code>register</code> storage class to be
    initialized.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="FR-register-const-in-file-scope.html">
      <em>named
        constants</em> as <code>const</code>-qualified objects
      with <code>register</code> storage class
      </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use designators (<code>.identifier</code>
    and <code>[constant-expression]</code>) uniformly for the access
    to the components of composite types.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow arrays to be of <code>register</code> storage class.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="FR-6.5.3.3.html">Unary <code>+</code> for rvalue conversion of
  arbitrary types.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Allow <code>setjmp</code> to be the initializer expression of a variable.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>C and C++ convergence</h2>

<p>
  A recent usenet discussion emphasize that a lot of the differences
  between C and C++ are there just gratuitously and serve no
  particular purpose that enforcing some ideological view points. So I
  started this collection here which is divided in three parts. What
  C++ can easily import from C, the other way round, and things that
  both got wrong or that are history and irrelevant for modern
  platforms.
</p>

<h3>Features that C++ could easily import from C11</h3>
<ul>
  <li>variably modified types (not necessarily VLA but pointers to VLA are
    nice)
  </li>
  <li>The concept and syntax of <code>restrict</code></li>
  <li>designated initializers</li>
  <li>compound literals</li>
  <li>type punning through unions</li>
  <li>compatible complex types</li>
  <li>bit-field ordering for <code>signed</code>, <code>un
  signed</code> and <code>bool</code> base type</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features that C++ could import from C11 but that would need some effort</h3>

<ul>
  <li>let the ternary operator return rvalues</li>
  <li>allow implicit cast of <code>void*</code> pointers to object pointers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features that C could easily import from C++11</h3>

<p>
  I probably don't know enough of C++ for this section. So please send
  me your ideas, if you have any.
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code>{}</code> for default initializers
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>nullptr</code>
  </li>
  <li>a wider concept of compile time constants</li>
  <li><code>static</code> declarations in <code>for</code>
  declarations</li>
  <li>declarations in <code>if</code> and <code>while</code>
  </li>
  <li>optional arguments for functions</li>
  <li><code>extern "C"</code></li>
  <li>references</li>
</ul>


<h3>Problems that C and C++ could tackle jointly in their next version</h3>


<ul>
  <li>
    fix signed integer representations to two's complement
  </li>
  <li>
    forbid trap representations for <code>0x80000...</code>, or
    equivalently force <code>TYPE_MIN</code> to have the
    value <code>-TYPE_MAX - 1</code> for all signed integer types.
  </li>
  <li>
    no padding bits for integral types
  </li>
  <li>
    force definition of <code>[u]intptr_t</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    force <code>ptrdiff_t</code> to be the signed type corresponding
    to <code>size_t</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    find a common ground for the inferred declared type feature, AKA C++'s
    "<code>auto</code>"
  </li>
  <li>
    find a common ground for <code>inline</code> functions
  </li>
  <li>
    find a new common definition of rvalue as <code>register</code>
    value
  </li>
  </ul>

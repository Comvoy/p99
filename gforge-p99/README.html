    The code of P99 should be usable and hopefully also useful. In
    contrast to that P99 as a project is only in its boot phase, so
    bare with me if you are missing documentation, examples, and any
    other kind of resources. The best to improve things is to let me
    know, there is my mailing address on the bottom of this page. Most
    communication will currently pass via my blog: <a
